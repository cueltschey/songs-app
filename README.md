# songs-app
This is my first webpage to help me get a handle on using typescript with react. It takes audio files (audio/mpeg) as input and stores them by artist. There is a simple search bar to find a desired song. files can be uploaded in batches.

# features
- can input any number of files
- can search for files by author or name
- files automatically organized by album
- embedded player allows playing from the web browser
