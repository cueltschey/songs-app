# songs-app
This is my first webpage to help me get a handle on using typescript with react. It takes audio files (audio/mpeg) as input and stores them by artist. There is a simple search bar to find a desired song. files can be uploaded in batches.

# in order to use 
1. make a vite project and replace the src file with this one.
2. in a terminal run npm install bootstrap and npm run dev
